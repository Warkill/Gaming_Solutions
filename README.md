Anti-Aimbot

Description:
The idea behind Anti-Aimbot is to solve what has become an epidemic in the gaming community where players use aimbots to target help target their opposition for them allowing for 100% shot accuracy! This is great, however it really hinders the player using this bot and destroys the gaming community where no one is able to truly trust the skill of your opposing team.

Idea:
I would like to find software developers able to create a program capable of removing the one factor that aimbots look for in game to find their target and lock on to it. I've heard different thoughts on how it works, ether a tag system (Name tags that hover over a hostile target in red) or simply that the target is tagged hostile in game as an enemy.

I feel that if youâ€™re able to remove that signal the aimbot will no longer be able to pick up on a target thus forcing your enemy (Using an aimbot) to engage in legitimate combat.

Please contact me if your a software developer interested in helping out with this project!
